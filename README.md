Unix Tools
===================

Tools I've created some time ago to automatize useful tasks. Run them as root!

## actualizator.sh

Tool for update Debian and some security tools.

### Dependancies and configuration

- svn
- wget

For configuration, set the folders you want to use for exploits and wireless.

## wepcrackeator.sh

Tool for testing WEP encripted routers. It's made to use an RT card, like RT73USB, because I have an internal card (a really bad one) and an external one, which can monitor and inject packets. Just change it if you want on the "Setting the environment" part.

### Dependancies

- aircrack-ng
- macchanger
